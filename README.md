```text
github "dehy/SwiftRadioPlayer" ~> 0.1.10
```

### Swift Package Manager

SwiftRadioPlayer is available through [SPM](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager). To install it, simply add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```text
.package(url: "https://github.com/dehy/SwiftRadioPlayer.git", from: "0.1.18")
```

### Manual

Drag the `Source` folder into your project.

## Usage

### Basics

1. Import `SwiftRadioPlayer` (if you are using Cocoapods)

```swift
import SwiftRadioPlayer
```

2. Get the singleton `SwiftRadioPlayer` instance

```swift
let player = SwiftRadioPlayer.shared
```

3. Set the delegate for the player

```swift
player.delegate = self
```

4. Set the radio URL
```swift
player.radioURL = URL(string: "http://example.com/station.mp3")
```

### Properties

- `isAutoPlay: Bool` The player starts playing when the `radioURL` property gets set. (default == `true`)

- `enableArtwork: Bool` Enable fetching albums artwork from the iTunes API. (default == `true`)

- `artworkSize: Int` Artwork image size. (default == `100` | 100x100).

- `rate: Float?` Read only property to get the current `AVPlayer` rate.

- `isPlaying: Bool` Read only property to check if the player is playing.

- `state: SwiftRadioPlayerState` Player current state of type `SwiftRadioPlayerState`.

- `playbackState: FRadioPlaybackState` Playing state of type `FRadioPlaybackState`.

### Playback controls

- Play
```swift
player.play()
```

- Pause
```swift
player.pause()
```

- Stop
```swift
player.stop()
```

- Toggle playing state
```swift
player.togglePlaying()
```

### Delegate methods

Called when player changes state
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, playerStateDidChange state: SwiftRadioPlayerState)
```

Called when the playback changes state
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, playbackStateDidChange state: FRadioPlaybackState)
```

Called when player changes the current player item
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, itemDidChange url: URL?)
```

Called when player item changes the timed metadata value
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, metadataDidChange artistName: String?, trackName: String?)
```

Called when player item changes the timed metadata value
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, metadataDidChange rawValue: String?)
```

Called when the player gets the artwork for the playing song
```swift
func radioPlayer(_ player: SwiftRadioPlayer, artworkDidChange artworkURL: URL?)
```

## Hacking

The Xcode project is generated automatically from `project.yml` using [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen). It's only checked in because Carthage needs it, do not edit it manually.

```sh
$ mint run yonaskolb/xcodegen
ðŸ’¾  Saved project to SwiftRadioPlayer.xcodeproj
```
